I am an incoming Computer Science student at Fordham University. Currently, I am enrolled in the Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship to enhance my knowledge of programming languages and achieve proficiency in various tools. 
I hope to collaborate with others and gain insights using Github in order to improve my skills.
